<p>The chi-squared test is a statistical hypothesis test that provides a quantitative method to compare observed frequencies with expected frequencies. For example, we could use a chi-squared test to evaluate if a coin is likely biased or to determine if elevated cholesterol is related to gender.

The general strategy to perform a chi-squared test is to calculate the chi-squared value (or chi-squared statistic), and then use a table of chi-squared values to estimate the probability that our result is due to chance alone. This probability is called the p-value. The null hypothesis, i.e., that the difference between expected and observed frequencies isnâ€™t significant, is typically accepted for p-values greater than .05.</p>

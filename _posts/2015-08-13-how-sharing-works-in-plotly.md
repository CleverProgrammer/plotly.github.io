#How Sharing Works

Plotly offers free, online tools for analyzing data and making graphs. In this tutorial we’ll show you some tips for better sharing of your plots, grids and folders using secret links, shared folders and the API. Also make sure to check out our other tutorials.

There are three categories of sharing for your Plotly grids and plots:

Public: Anyone can view it. It will appear in your profile and can appear in search engines. You do not need to be logged in to Plotly to view it.

Private: Only you can view it. It will not appear in the Plotly feed, your profile, or search engines. You must be logged in to Plotly to view it. You can privately share it with other Plotly users in your online Plotly account but they will need to be logged in to view it.

Secret: Anyone with this secret link can view it. It will not appear in the Plotly feed, your profile, or search engines. If it is embedded inside a webpage or an IPython notebook, anybody who is viewing that page will be able to view it. You do not need to be logged in to view it.

###Private Share Links

A secret link is a private link which can be viewed by anybody with the private link URL. Private URLs are long, obfuscated URLs that are practically impossible to guess. Anybody who has a private URL can view the graph. They don't need a Plotly account and they don't need to log in. 

From the **Organize** app you can click on the **Share** button  | ![Shared plot](/static/images/how-sharing-works-in-plotly/shared-plot.png) (share-plot) | ![Private share link](/static/images/how-sharing-works-in-plotly/private-share-link.png)

You can tell a privately-shared plot from the word “Private” written above it, accompanied by a closed lock.  | ![Shared plot](/static/images/how-sharing-works-in-plotly/shared-plot.png)

###How do shared folders work? (talk to Alex)

All Plotly users, free or paid, enjoy unlimited private folders.

Changing folder from private to public: "Making this folder public will also make all of its contents public. Are you sure?"

Changing folder from public to private: "Are you sure you want to make this folder private?"

Moving an item to a public folder: "[folder name] is public. Moving this to a public folder will make it accessible to everyone. Are you sure?"

Creating a new item in a public folder: "[folder name] is public. Creating a file inside of a public folder will make it accessible to everyone. Are you sure?

###How does this work with the APIs?

 This functionality is also accessible from the [API libraries](https://plot.ly/api). View each page for details:

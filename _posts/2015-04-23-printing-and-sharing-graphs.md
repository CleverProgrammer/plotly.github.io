At Plotly, we love sharing. It’s easy to share or print a Plotly chart. Here’s how.

###Sharing: Direct link, facebook, and more

If you’re looking at a graph that you love, like the one we embedded at the top of this tutorial, go ahead and share it with your friends and colleagues! To do this, look no further than the sharing options in the lower right hand corner of the plot. You can use a direct link, a code to embed the graph in your website or blog (we have a <a href="https://plot.ly/embed/">tutorial</a> for that!), or share using Facebook, Twitter or Google+. | ![How to share and print plotly graphs](/static/images/printing-and-sharing-graphs/image03.png)
In your workspace, the command center for graphs that you’ve created, look for the Share button in the upper left of the screen. Click it. | ![How to share and print plotly graphs](/static/images/printing-and-sharing-graphs/image00.png)
The “Sharing settings” box gives you complete control of your chart&#8217;s privacy settings. You can decide if you want your graph to be public or private. To share your graph on a public site, you’ll need to make sure you select Public. Plotly allows you to share your graph and data with collaborators as well. Users you assign as collaborators can edit your graphs with you. You can do this with both public and private graphs. Student options can be selected to help teachers sort their students’ work quickly. | ![How to share and print plotly graphs](/static/images/printing-and-sharing-graphs/image07.png)

### Printing: Save and print.

To print a Plotly graph, we recommend you save the graph to your computer, and then print. If you want to print someone else’s graph, you can “fork and edit” the graph into your own workspace.

In your workspace, look for the Download button in the toolbar above your graph. To save time, you can use our keyboard shortcuts. On a Mac, “Command-P” and on a PC “Control-P” | ![How to share and print plotly graphs](/static/images/printing-and-sharing-graphs/image02.png)

From the “Download/Export” box, you can select from a.png, .pdf, .svg or .eps files. Once you’ve picked your favorite file format, click the download button. The file will be saved in your download folder. Open the file, and print. Notice the “Include public link” button. Select the box to include your graph&#8217;s URL on the static image. This way, if you email your graph to a friend, they will have an easy way to find your interactive graph and data. | ![How to share and print plotly graphs](/static/images/printing-and-sharing-graphs/image05.png)

**Quick tip:** Let’s say you want to print a copy of the graph we embedded at the top of this tutorial. That graph is hosted at:

[https://plot.ly/~abtran/14](https://plot.ly/~abtran/14)

To print that graph, you can add **.png**, **.pdf**, or **.svg** to the end of the URL, open the webpage and print from your browser. For example:

[https://plot.ly/~abtran/14.pdf](https://plot.ly/~abtran/14)

Opens a pdf version of your graph. You can save or print right from the browser.

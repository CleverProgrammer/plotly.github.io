If you think you want to know more about what box plots are, read this dataliteracy article by Ben Chartoff: [http://plot.ly/boxplot](http://plot.ly/boxplot). Follow along below to make a boxplot of your own.

### Step 1: Set up the grid

This is one way you could set up Plotly’s grid to make the graph above: [https://plot.ly/~cimar/205](https://plot.ly/~cimar/205). | ![How to make a box plot online](/static/images/how-to-make-a-boxplot/image03.png)
Select “Box plots” from the MAKE A PLOT menu. | ![How to make a box plot online](/static/images/how-to-make-a-boxplot/image18.png)
Click the blue plot button in the sidebar to create the chart.  (For more help with the grid see: [https://plot.ly/add-data-to-the-plotly-grid/](https://plot.ly/add-data-to-the-plotly-grid/) ) | ![How to make a box plot online](/static/images/how-to-make-a-boxplot/image09.png)

### Step 2: Traces

Your plot should look something like this.  Open the TRACES popover in the toolbar. | ![How to make a box plot online](/static/images/how-to-make-a-boxplot/image12.png) ![How to make a box plot online](/static/images/how-to-make-a-boxplot/image13.png)
This is what the “Mode” tab of the TRACES popover should look like for “All Traces (Box)”. We’ve elected to show all points alongside our boxes, not just the outliers. | ![How to make a box plot online](/static/images/how-to-make-a-boxplot/image02.png)

### Step 3: Style and annotate!

Your plot should look something like this. In order to get the graph at the top of the chart, you’ll need to style it more. | ![How to make a box plot online](/static/images/how-to-make-a-boxplot/image05.png) ![How to make a box plot online](/static/images/how-to-make-a-boxplot/image13.png)
This is what the “Style” tab of the TRACES popover should look like for “All Traces (Box)”.We’ve narrowed our boxes, spread them out more, and stroked them with a thinner weight. We’ve also made the accompanying points smaller and more spread-out. | ![How to make a box plot online](/static/images/how-to-make-a-boxplot/image10.png)
We’ve also changed the fill color of each trace in the “Mode” tab of the TRACES popover. This is what the tab looks like for “Carmelo Anthony”. | ![How to make a box plot online](/static/images/how-to-make-a-boxplot/image16.png)
(Alternative: We didn’t, but you can also change the color of the box plot strokes, in the “Style” tab of the TRACES popover.) | ![How to make a box plot online](/static/images/how-to-make-a-boxplot/image19.png)
Here’s how the LAYOUT popover should look. We’ve nudged the top margin, and we’re giving our chart a grey background. We’ve also changed the font. | ![How to make a box plot online](/static/images/how-to-make-a-boxplot/image04.png) ![How to make a box plot online](/static/images/how-to-make-a-boxplot/image06.png)
This is what the “Lines” tab of the AXES popover looks like for “All Axes”. We’ve made the grid lines white, and the x-axis a little heavier. | ![How to make a box plot online](/static/images/how-to-make-a-boxplot/image14.png)
This is what the “Labels” tab of the AXES popover looks like for “X Axis”. We’ve rotated the labels. | ![How to make a box plot online](/static/images/how-to-make-a-boxplot/image00.png)
We’re hiding the legend in the LEGEND popover. | ![How to make a box plot online](/static/images/how-to-make-a-boxplot/image08.png)
We’ve titled our chart, and used markup to format our text and source our data, which in this case is another plotly graph. | ![How to make a box plot online](/static/images/how-to-make-a-boxplot/image07.png) Points Scored per NBA Game - data taken from [Points Scored by the Top 50 Scoring NBA Players in 2012](https://plot.ly/jackp/969)
Your finished chart should look something like this: | ![How to make a box plot online](/static/images/how-to-make-a-boxplot/image17.png)

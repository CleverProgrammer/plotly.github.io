Follow along below to make a heatmap in Plotly.

###Step 1: Set up the grid

This is one way you could set up Plotly’s grid to make the graph above. The rows and columns of the grid will correspond to the rows and columns of the heat map, the column names will name the column (data here: [https://plot.ly/~cimar/191](https://plot.ly/~cimar/191)|![How to make a heatmap online](https://plot.ly/static/learn/images/web_app_tutorials/how-to-make-a-heatmap-online/image05.png) ![How to make a heatmap online](https://plot.ly/static/learn/images/web_app_tutorials/how-to-make-a-heatmap-online/image05.png)
Select “Heat map” from the MAKE A PLOT menu.|![How to make a heatmap online](https://plot.ly/static/learn/images/web_app_tutorials/how-to-make-a-heatmap-online/image06.png)
Select the “Column names” button from the X-AXIS options in the sidebar and click “Select all columns” button.| ![How to make a heatmap online](https://plot.ly/static/learn/images/web_app_tutorials/how-to-make-a-heatmap-online/image10.png)
Deselect any columns you don’t want to plot, and your row names column if you have one. This will be your “y” value.| ![How to make a heatmap online](https://plot.ly/static/learn/images/web_app_tutorials/how-to-make-a-heatmap-online/image02.png)
Click the blue plot button in the sidebar to create the chart.  (For more help with the grid see: [https://plot.ly/add-data-to-the-plotly-grid/](/add-data-to-the-plotly-grid/) | ![How to make a heatmap online](https://plot.ly/static/learn/images/web_app_tutorials/how-to-make-a-heatmap-online/image07.png)

###Step 2: Traces

Your plot should look something like this.  The first step to styling it into the heatmap above is to open the TRACES popover in the toolbar.| ![How to make a heatmap online](https://plot.ly/static/learn/images/web_app_tutorials/how-to-make-a-heatmap-online/image00.png) ![How to make a heatmap online](https://plot.ly/static/learn/images/web_app_tutorials/how-to-make-a-heatmap-online/image12.png)
This is what the “Style” tab of the TRACES popover should look like. We’ve selected one of the default gradients, red-yellow-blue.| ![How to make a heatmap online](https://plot.ly/static/learn/images/web_app_tutorials/how-to-make-a-heatmap-online/image14.png)
For this particular data, we also want to center our gradient so that yellow correlates to a value of 60.2, and everything above or below is a little red or green. The easiest way to do this is by nudging the “Z range” values in the “Range/bins” tab to converge on our desired midpoint  &#8212; we compressed our range, but you can also stretch it if you prefer the effect.| ![How to make a heatmap online](https://plot.ly/static/learn/images/web_app_tutorials/how-to-make-a-heatmap-online/image03.png)
(Alternative: if you want to make a contour plot, just change the “Type” setting in the “Mode” tab.)| ![How to make a heatmap online](https://plot.ly/static/learn/images/web_app_tutorials/how-to-make-a-heatmap-online/image13.png) ![How to make a heatmap online](https://plot.ly/static/learn/images/web_app_tutorials/how-to-make-a-heatmap-online/image01.png)

###Step 3: Style and annotate!

Your plot should look something like this.  There’s a little more styling you need to do to get the graph at the top of the chart.| ![How to make a heatmap online](https://plot.ly/static/learn/images/web_app_tutorials/how-to-make-a-heatmap-online/image16.png) ![How to make a heatmap online](https://plot.ly/static/learn/images/web_app_tutorials/how-to-make-a-heatmap-online/image12.png)
Here’s how the LAYOUT popover should look. We’ve nudged the margins to accommodate the y-axis labels, and we’re giving our chart a grey background.| ![How to make a heatmap online](https://plot.ly/static/learn/images/web_app_tutorials/how-to-make-a-heatmap-online/image11.png) ![How to make a heatmap online](https://plot.ly/static/learn/images/web_app_tutorials/how-to-make-a-heatmap-online/image04.png)
We’ve titled our chart, and used markup to format our text and source our data.| ![How to make a heatmap online](https://plot.ly/static/learn/images/web_app_tutorials/how-to-make-a-heatmap-online/image09.png)
Your finished chart should look something like this:| ![How to make a heatmap online](https://plot.ly/static/learn/images/web_app_tutorials/how-to-make-a-heatmap-online/image15.png)

#Update your Grids and Plots

Plotly offers free, online tools for analyzing data and making graphs. In this tutorial we’ll show you how to update your Grids and Plots with new data. Make sure to check out our other tutorials.

There are two different options for updating your Plots. Note that in both cases you have to save your newly-modified Grid to update your Plot, and you still have to open and close the Plot to see the changes.

### Option 1

You can update data in a plot by using Insert Info. Do this only if you want to add a new trace to a graph, from either the same Grid or a different one.

1) navigate to the Grid in question in the Workspace and select the drop down next to “Make a new plot”

2) select the plot you want to update (note: only open tabs will be shown in the menu so you have to open the tab of the graph you want to update).

You can open multiple Grids by selecting multiple files and clicking the Open Action above. Data from these Grids can then be inserted into any open Plot.

### Option 2

1) Create your initial data set and make a new Plot, then save the Plot. Saving the Plot will automatically save a Grid with the same name but with " Grid" appended to the filename. Close the Plot.

2) Click on Organize, open your newly-saved Grid and click Save again.

3) When you reopen your Plot you will notice that the Plot has been
automatically updated with the new modifications.

###Step 1 : Set up the grid

Weâ€™ve already entered the [loss data](https://plot.ly/~Dreamshot/3163) into Plotly.
Click the link to open the data in your workspace. 

###Step 2 : Sort by Text

Once you've loaded the data in Plotly, select the "text" group by option on the left panel. 
This will instruct Plotly to display the text for each point directly on the plot.
Thereafter, click "MAKE A PLOT" then "SCATTER PLOTS."

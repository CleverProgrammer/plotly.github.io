###Step 1: Set up the grid

This is one way you could set up Plotly’s grid to make the graph above (data here: [https://plot.ly/~cimar/209](https://plot.ly/~cimar/209) ). | ![How to make a graph with error bars online](/static/images/graph-with-error-bars/bit1.png)
Select “Scatter plot” from the MAKE A PLOT menu. You can also add error bars to line plots and bar charts. | ![How to make a graph with error bars online](/static/images/graph-with-error-bars/bit2.png)
Click the “Error bars” option in the sidebar.| ![How to make a graph with error bars online](/static/images/graph-with-error-bars/image15.png)
Select the column of error values that correspond to your y-values. | ![How to make a graph with error bars online](/static/images/graph-with-error-bars/image20.png)
(Alternatives: you can also select error values to correspond to your x-values or | ![How to make a graph with error bars online](/static/images/graph-with-error-bars/image13.png)
by selecting the “Asymmetric errors” option instead, you can set two different sets of error values for each coordinate. “Ey-” sets the length of the bar extending beneath each point, and “Ey” sets the length of the bar extending out from above it.) | ![How to make a graph with error bars online](/static/images/graph-with-error-bars/image23.png) ![How to make a graph with error bars online](/static/images/graph-with-error-bars/image07.png)
Click the blue plot button in the sidebar to create the chart.  (For more help with the grid see: [https://plot.ly/add-data-to-the-plotly-grid/](https://plot.ly/add-data-to-the-plotly-grid/) | ![How to make a graph with error bars online](/static/images/graph-with-error-bars/image18.png)

###Step 2: Edit the error bars


Your plot should look something like this. Open the TRACES popover in the toolbar. | ![How to make a graph with error bars online](/static/images/graph-with-error-bars/image00.png) ![How to make a graph with error bars online](/static/images/graph-with-error-bars/image12.png)
This is what the “Error bars” tab of the TRACES popover should look like. We changed the weight of the bars, and made their feet a little wider. | ![How to make a graph with error bars online](/static/images/graph-with-error-bars/image11.png)
(Alternative: you can add new error bars to a line plot, scatter plot, or bar chart from the TRACES popover. For example, you can add red error bars to the x-coordinates of every point, and set their length to 4% of the x-coordinate’s value.) | ![How to make a graph with error bars online](/static/images/graph-with-error-bars/image05.png) ![How to make a graph with error bars online](/static/images/graph-with-error-bars/image21.png)

###Step 3: Style and annotate!

Your plot should look something like this. In order to get the graph at the top of the chart, you’ll need to style it. | ![How to make a graph with error bars online](/static/images/graph-with-error-bars/image14.png) ![How to make a graph with error bars online](/static/images/graph-with-error-bars/image12.png)
This is what the “Mode” and “Style” tabs of the TRACES popover should look like for “Mean”. For more information on styling line and scatter charts, check out: [http://help.plot.ly/make-a-line-or-scatter-graph/](/make-a-line-or-scatter-graph/) | ![How to make a graph with error bars online](/static/images/graph-with-error-bars/image17.png) ![How to make a graph with error bars online](/static/images/graph-with-error-bars/image08.png)
Here’s how the LAYOUT popover should look. We’ve nudged the top margin, and we’re giving our chart a grey background. We’ve also changed the font. | ![How to make a graph with error bars online](/static/images/graph-with-error-bars/image02.png) ![How to make a graph with error bars online](/static/images/graph-with-error-bars/image03.png)
This is what the “Lines” tab of the AXES popover looks like for “All Axes”. We’ve made the grid lines white. | ![How to make a graph with error bars online](/static/images/graph-with-error-bars/image22.png)
We’re hiding the legend in the LEGEND popover. | ![How to make a graph with error bars online](/static/images/graph-with-error-bars/image06.png)
Your finished chart should look something like this: | ![How to make a graph with error bars online](/static/images/graph-with-error-bars/image01.png)

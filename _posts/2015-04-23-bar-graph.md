###Step 1A: Set up the grid (two traces)

If you’re trying to make a bar chart like the one above, which compares two different sets of numbers in the same categories, you have options getting started.
The first option is to arrange these two data sets into two different columns.

This is one way you could set up Plotly’s grid to make the graph above (data here: [https://plot.ly/~cimar/191](https://plot.ly/~cimar/191) ). | ![How to make a bar chart online](/static/images/bar-graph/image15.png)
Select “Bar plot” from the MAKE A PLOT menu. | ![How to make a bar chart online](/static/images/bar-graph/image02.png)
Click the blue plot button in the sidebar to create the chart.  (For more help with the grid, see: [https://plot.ly/add-data-to-the-plotly-grid/](https://plot.ly/add-data-to-the-plotly-grid) ) | ![https://plot.ly/add-data-to-the-plotly-grid](/static/images/bar-graph/image11.png)

###Step 1b: Set-up the grid (Group by)

Your second option is to have a column of variables identifying which dataset each row belongs to, and then “grouping by” this column.

This is another way you could Plotly’s grid to make the graph above (data here: [https://plot.ly/~cimar/198](https://plot.ly/~cimar/198) ). | ![How to make a bar chart online](/static/images/bar-graph/image21.png)

Select “Bar plot” from the MAKE A PLOT menu.  |  ![How to make a bar chart online](/static/images/bar-graph/image19.png)

Select “Group by” from the OPTIONS in the sidebar, and select your options column. | ![How to make a bar chart online](/static/images/bar-graph/image12.png) ![How to make a bar chart online](/static/images/bar-graph/image06.png)

Click the blue plot button in the sidebar to create the chart.  (For more help with the grid see: [https://plot.ly/add-data-to-the-plotly-grid](https://plot.ly/add-data-to-the-plotly-grid) ) | ![https://plot.ly/add-data-to-the-plotly-grid](/static/images/bar-graph/image11.png)

###Step 2: Setting the Traces

Your plot should look something like this.  The first step to styling it into the horizontal bar graph above is to open the TRACES popover in the toolbar. | ![How to make a bar chart online](/static/images/bar-graph/image20.png) ![How to make a bar chart online](/static/images/bar-graph/screen1.png)
Select &#8220;All Traces (bar)&#8221; from the drop down menu.Click on &#8220;Flip bars &amp; Axis config&#8221; to make your bar chart horizontal. | ![How to make a bar chart online](/static/images/bar-graph/screen2.png) ![How to make a bar chart online](/static/images/bar-graph/screen3.png)
(Alternative: if you want to stack or overlay your bars, instead of grouping them, just change the &#8220;Mode&#8221; setting.) | ![How to make a bar chart online](/static/images/bar-graph/image04.png) ![How to make a bar chart online](/static/images/bar-graph/image23.png)

###Step 3: Style it!

Now your plot should look something like this: a grouped horizontal bar chart. We still have some styling to do to get the plot at the top of this tutorial! Open TRACES again. | ![How to make a bar chart online](/static/images/bar-graph/image00.png)

This is how the “Style” tab of the TRACES popover on “LA Zoo” should look. We’ve altered every option in this panel: Opacity, Bar Gap, Group Gap, Fill, and Border. | ![How to make a bar chart online](/static/images/bar-graph/screen4.png)

This is how the “Style” tab of the TRACES popover on “SF Zoo” should look. These are the same as for LA Zoo, but fill and border are different colors. | ![How to make a bar chart online](/static/images/bar-graph/screen5.png)

This is how the LAYOUT popover should look. We’re changing the font throughout the plot.  We’re also giving the plot a grey background, and nudging the margins. | ![How to make a bar chart online](/static/images/bar-graph/image07.png) ![How to make a bar chart online](/static/images/bar-graph/image13.png)

This is how the AXES popover should look.  We’re giving the plot thicker white gridlines. | ![How to make a bar chart online](/static/images/bar-graph/screen6.png)

This is how the LEGEND popover should look, we’re giving it a grey background, and moving the position. | ![How to make a bar chart online](/static/images/bar-graph/screen7.png)

Your finished chart should look something like this. | ![How to make a bar chart online](/static/images/bar-graph/image22.png)

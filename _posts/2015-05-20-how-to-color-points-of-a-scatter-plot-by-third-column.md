###Step 1 : Set up the grid

Weâ€™ve already entered the [sepal and petal data](https://plot.ly/~Dreamshot/3249) into Plotly. 
Click the link to open the data in your workspace. 

###Step 2: Graph the data

Once the data has opened in your workspace, specify your X and Y AXES, then select "Group By" in the left panel display and specify the right-most column, the name, as "G." Lastly, head up to the "MAKE A PLOT" button and select "Scatter plots." Then make a "Scatter plot." See the image below for a visualization.

###Step 3: Editing Your Graph

Your newly-graphed data should look something like this:

You'll want to add labels for the X and Y axes (Sepal Length and Width, respectively). Notice how your legend specifies the type of Iris; each Iris has a different scatter color on the plot.

Remember to title your plot. You can hover over the scatter points for more information!

Plotly graphs offer zoom, pan, and hover functionality. 
Focus on intricate data in an instant or zoom out to see the bigger picture. 
The data is always at your finger tips.

In this guide, we'll explore these four techniques: drag to zoom-in & double-click to autoscale (1), drag the corners
of the graph to zoom only along one axis (2), double click an axes to autoscale that axis (3) and changing the hover mode (4). The easiest way to demonstrate each feature is through an informational GIF, so look for one of those on each topic below. We are going to use <a href="https://plot.ly/~Dreamshot/628/climate-change-attribution/">this graph of climate change attribution</a> if you'd like to play with it yourself.

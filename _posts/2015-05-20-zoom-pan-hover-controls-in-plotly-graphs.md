Bring your graphing and data analysis to the next level! Plotly lets you zoom, pan, and hover. Zoom in to reveal important details or zoom out to see the bigger picture. The data is always at your finger tips.

In this guide, we'll show you how to 

1. Drag to zoom in and double-click to return to the original graph.
2. Drag the corners of a graph to zoom along one axis.
3. Double-click to autoscale a single axis.
4. Change the hover mode to compare data or investigate a single data point.

Follow along and investigate the impact of various factors (volanic, ozone, solar, greenhouse gases, sulfate) with our [graph on historical temperature changes](https://plot.ly/~Dreamshot/628/climate-change-attribution/).

###1. Drag to zoom in and double-click to autoscale

#How to Enter Data in the Grid

### Step 1: Set up the Grid

The first step to making any Plotly graph is setting up the data in a grid.
You can type your data directly into a grid, or copy it from a spreadsheet and paste it in.


Open a + NEW grid from the file well. | ![Add data to the plotly grid](/static/images/enter-data-in-the-grid/new-grid.png)

Type directly into the cells, or type &#8220;ctrl-v&#8221; to paste in clipboard content. | ![Add data to the plotly grid](/static/images/enter-data-in-the-grid/image03.png)

Name your new grid and save it to the filewell, to have it on-hand for future plots and to share it. | ![Add data to the plotly grid](/static/images/enter-data-in-the-grid/image12.png) ![Add data to the plotly grid](/static/images/enter-data-in-the-grid/image07.png)

You can import .csv, .xls, or .xlsx files directly into Plotly. Additionally, you can import data from Google Drive and Dropbox.

Upload a file using the IMPORT tab. | ![Add data to the plotly grid](/static/images/enter-data-in-the-grid/import-from-google-drive.png) ![Add data to the plotly grid](/static/images/enter-data-in-the-grid/image05.png)
If you upload a workbook, a new grid will be created for every sheet within the book&#8230; | ![Add data to the plotly grid](/static/images/enter-data-in-the-grid/image13.png)
&#8230;they’re all stored in a folder named after your file in the filewell. | ![Add data to the plotly grid](/static/images/enter-data-in-the-grid/image04.png)

**View Data**
You can extract the data from any Plotly graph, and build your own graph out of it!

Go to any graph page. The one pictured to the right is [https://plot.ly/~slkent/51](https://plot.ly/~slkent/51). Click the DATA button, located in the lefthand sidebar, to view the data. To load the data in your workspace, click on "Fork and edit". | ![Add data to the plotly grid](/static/images/enter-data-in-the-grid/view-data-fork-and-edit.png)
Click the VIEW DATA button, located in the toolbar, to view the data. | ![Add data to the plotly grid](/static/images/enter-data-in-the-grid/get-data.png)
&#8230;the column names should let you know what role they played in the original plot. | ![Add data to the plotly grid](/static/images/enter-data-in-the-grid/image00.png)
Save and name your new data set and save it to the filewell, to have it on-hand for future plots and to share it. | ![Add data to the plotly grid](/static/images/enter-data-in-the-grid/save-data.png) 

###Step 2: Plot

Once your grid is set up, you’re ready to plot!

Select your plot type from the MAKE A PLOT menu. | ![Add data to the plotly grid](/static/images/enter-data-in-the-grid/image14.png)
Click the OPTIONS you’d like to enable in the sidebar&#8230; | ![Add data to the plotly grid](/static/images/enter-data-in-the-grid/image17.png)
&#8230;then set your variables with the buttons that have appeared below the column headers&#8230; | ![Add data to the plotly grid](/static/images/enter-data-in-the-grid/image16.png)
&#8230;different colors indicate different data sets. These will be plotted as different colors by default. | ![Add data to the plotly grid](/static/images/enter-data-in-the-grid/image10.png)
Click the PLOT button at the bottom of the sidebar to make your plot. You can either make a new plot (default) or add to an existing one. | ![Add data to the plotly grid](/static/images/enter-data-in-the-grid/image02.png)

###Step 1: Set up the grid


This is how you would set up Plotly’s grid to make the graph above (data here: [https://plot.ly/~cimar/173](https://plot.ly/~cimar/173) .| ![How to make a line graph and scatter plot online](https://plot.ly/static/learn/images/web_app_tutorials/how-to-make-a-line-graph-and-scatter-plot-online/image16.png)
Select “Line plot” from the MAKE A PLOT menu.|![How to make a line graph and scatter plot online](https://plot.ly/static/learn/images/web_app_tutorials/how-to-make-a-line-graph-and-scatter-plot-online/image02.png)
Click the blue plot button in the sidebar to create the chart.  (For more help with the grid see: [https://plot.ly/grid](https://plot.ly/grid)| ![How to make a line graph and scatter plot online](https://plot.ly/static/learn/images/web_app_tutorials/how-to-make-a-line-graph-and-scatter-plot-online/image13.png)

###Step 2: Setting the traces

Your plot should look something like this. All the traces are line plots with markers. The first step to styling it into the mixed-type graph above is to open the TRACES popover in the toolbar.| ![How to make a line graph and scatter plot online](https://plot.ly/static/learn/images/web_app_tutorials/how-to-make-a-line-graph-and-scatter-plot-online/image12.png)![How to make a line graph and scatter plot online](https://plot.ly/static/learn/images/wow-to-make-a-line-graph-and-scatter-plot-online/image11.png)
Here’s how the “Mode” tab of the TRACES popover for “trace 0” should look.|![How to make a line graph and scatter plot online](https://plot.ly/static/learn/images/web_app_tutorials/how-to-make-a-line-graph-and-scatter-plot-online/image09.png)
Here’s how the “Mode” tab of the TRACES popover for “trace 1” should look. Notice that we’ve selected the marker without a line option &#8212; this is how you get a scatter plot.|![How to make a line graph and scatter plot online](https://plot.ly/static/learn/images/web_app_tutorials/how-to-make-a-line-graph-and-scatter-plot-online/image00.png)
Here’s how the “Mode” tab of the TRACES popover for “trace 2” should look. Notice that we’ve selected the line without marker option.| ![How to make a line graph and scatter plot online](https://plot.ly/static/learn/images/web_app_tutorials/how-to-make-a-line-graph-and-scatter-plot-online/image10.png)

###Step 3: Style it!

Now your plot should look something like this: a mixed line and scatter plot. We still have some styling to do to get the plot at the top of this tutorial! Open TRACES again.| [![How to make a line graph and scatter plot online](https://plot.ly/static/learn/images/web_app_tutorials/how-to-make-a-line-graph-and-scatter-plot-online/image14.png)](https://plot.ly/static/learn/images/web_app_tutorials/how-to-make-a-line-graph-and-scatter-plot-online/image14.png)
This is how the “Style” tab of the TRACES popover on “trace 0” should look. We’ve smoothed the line, changed the stroke, and made the markers larger.| ![How to make a line graph and scatter plot online](https://plot.ly/static/learn/images/web_app_tutorials/how-to-make-a-line-graph-and-scatter-plot-online/image05.png)
This is how the “Style” tab of the TRACES popover on “trace 1” should look. We’ve changed the stroke and its weight.| ![How to make a line graph and scatter plot online](https://plot.ly/static/learn/images/web_app_tutorials/how-to-make-a-line-graph-and-scatter-plot-online/image01.png)
This is how the “Style” tab of the TRACES popover on “trace 2” should look. We’ve changed the shape of the marker and its outline.| ![How to make a line graph and scatter plot online](https://plot.ly/static/learn/images/web_app_tutorials/how-to-make-a-line-graph-and-scatter-plot-online/image03.png)
This is how the LAYOUT popover should look. We’re giving the plot a grey background.| ![How to make a line graph and scatter plot online](https://plot.ly/static/learn/images/web_app_tutorials/how-to-make-a-line-graph-and-scatter-plot-online/image17.png)
This is how the AXES popover should look.  We’re giving the plot white gridlines.| ![How to make a line graph and scatter plot online](https://plot.ly/static/learn/images/web_app_tutorials/how-to-make-a-line-graph-and-scatter-plot-online/image15.png)
We’re hiding our legend in the LEGEND popover.| ![How to make a line graph and scatter plot online](https://plot.ly/static/learn/images/web_app_tutorials/how-to-make-a-line-graph-and-scatter-plot-online/image18.png)
Your finished chart should look something like this.| ![How to make a line graph and scatter plot online](https://plot.ly/static/learn/images/web_app_tutorials/how-to-make-a-line-graph-and-scatter-plot-online/image04.png)

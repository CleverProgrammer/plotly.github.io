Area plots are the same as scatter and line plots, but with different trace options selected to fill the area under the curve. Follow along below to make an area plot in Plotly.

###Step 1: Setting up the data in the grid


This is how you would set up Plotly’s grid to make the graph above (data here: [https://plot.ly/~Dreamshot/566](https://plot.ly/~Dreamshot/566])). Click the blue plot button to create the chart. | ![How to make an area chart](/static/images/How-to-make-an-area-graph/image10.png)

###Step 2: Adding fill under traces

To make an area plot from a line plot, edit the “Fill To” attribute in the Mode tab of the TRACES popover.

Here’s how the TRACES popover for “trace 0” looks. Notice “Fill To” has been set to “Y=0”. | ![How to make an area chart online](/static/images/How-to-make-an-area-graph/image09.png)
Here’s how the TRACES popover for “trace 1” looks. Notice “Fill To” has been set to “Next Y”. | ![How to make an area chart online](/static/images/How-to-make-an-area-graph/image04.png)

###Step 3: Optional styling to make your plot prettier

Nice! Now you have your area plot. If you want, you can change the colors and apply smoothing to the lines to get a chart that looks like one at the top of the tutorial.

Here’s how your area chart looks before styling. | ![How to make an area chart online](/static/images/How-to-make-an-area-graph/image00-area-graph.png)
Here’s how the TRACES popover looks with smoothing and the change of colors. The smoothing button is highlighted in red. | ![How to make an area chart online](/static/images/How-to-make-an-area-graph/image06.png) ![How to make an area chart online](/static/images/How-to-make-an-area-graph/image02.png)
Here’s how the AXES popover looks with the axes lines thickened and made white. | ![How to make an area chart online](/static/images/How-to-make-an-area-graph/image07.png)
Here’s how the LAYOUT popover looks with the plot and margin background color changed to grey. |![Ĥow to make an area chart online](/static/images/How-to-make-an-area-graph/image03.png)
Your finished chart should look something like this. | ![How to make an area chart online](/static/images/How-to-make-an-area-graph/image01.png)

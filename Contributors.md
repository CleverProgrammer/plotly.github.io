## Front Matter

- layout: `two_column_layout` | `one_column_layout`
- title: What appears 
- state: `inactive` | `active`
  `active` - it will appear in the table of contents
  `inactive` - it won't appear in the table of contents, but it will appear at the url


## Images
- Image filenames and alt tags should be as descriptive as possible, up to 5 or 6 words. 
  This is the text that will fill in for the images for folks that use screen readers. Also, google bots!

  Instead of: `static/images/quad-fits/img1.png`
  Do: `static/images/quadtratic-fits/four-quadtratic-polynomials.png`
